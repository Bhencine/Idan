    </p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>

      Ilorin in Ilorin, Nigeria in 2010. He also holds a Masters of Science
      (MSc) degree in Strategy, Leadership and Change from Edinburgh Business

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>
      After Ogunmola graduated from the University in Nigeria, he struggled to
      get a job for at least two years. During this time, he says he felt there
      was more to his life. In his attempt to make a difference with his life
      during this period, he realised that the situation was not peculiar to him
      alone, as several other young people were facing a similar challenge. This
      inspired him to begin to find means to help these demography of people. He
      began to work with universities to help young people develop project
      management skills. He also contacted a number of businesses to try and
      understand the skills and competencies they looked for from Nigerian
      graduates, and began to develop the company's engagement and value
      proposition around these skills. This was the birth of Utiva.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more he helped people, he wasn't still satisfied with his reach, as
      statistics revealed to him there were several hundreds of people scattered
      around Africa in need of what he was doing. This is what led to him
      launching Utiva in October 2018, with the objective of helping Africans
      learn premium technology skills, and leverage technology to help employers
      around the world find the best talents. As a young product manager,
      Eyitayo moved to the United States in 2015 to join Creative Associates
      International as a product manager, working at the Creative and later
      joined Afrissance in 2017 as a Vice President.

      He is a 2015 Atlas Corps fellow and a mentor of the Tony Elumelu
      Foundation Program. In 2019, Eyitayo was made a fellow of the Global Good
      fund. He is also a Chevening alumnus. Eyitayo is a web3 evangelist.

      His company, Utiva, has been accredited in the United Kingdom as an
      education and learning platform. He kick-started a project tagged, “EyiEko
      Project”, which is set to empower 10,000 young Nigerians with access to
